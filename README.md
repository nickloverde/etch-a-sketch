- The crux of this project was learning how to create a new div using Javascript. I initially tried two other methods unsuccessfully before I found my current solution on google. 

- Project really re-enforced the idea of keeping the html as simple as possible and focusing more on javascript to create a lot of the material.

- Again, built on experience with event listeners -- this time using a 'mouse over' instead of a 'click'
